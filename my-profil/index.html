			<h2> E </h2>
			</div>
		<p>For entrepreneur.
		An entrepreneur is a person at the origin of the creation of an economic activity, in most cases ex nihilo. Formulated differently, an entrepreneur is a business leader who has the skills and motivation sufficient to create an economic activity, enter a sector of activity, create jobs, etc. Several elements characterize an entrepreneur: a strong involvement in his project, a significant material and / or moral investment, a personality marked by natural leadership</p>

			<div class="letters">
			<h2> P </h2>
			</div>
		<p>For Passion.
		Passion is a very strong emotion turned towards a person, a concept, or an object producing a psychological imbalance (the object of the passion occupies the mind excessively).
		Passion results in a feeling of unusual excitement alternating between pleasure and suffering due to the significant drop in serotonin1 (neurotransmitter responsible for the emotional state of happiness) and the increase in dopamine (neurotransmitter causing the sensation pleasure) which activates the reward system</p>

		<div  class="white-card">
			<div class="letters">
			<h2> M </h2>
			</div>
		<p>For Money.
		Money is a medium of exchange, most often materialized in the form of banknotes and coins, which is accepted by a society to pay for goods, services and all kinds of obligations. It is therefore a payment instrument.</p>
		</div>

		<div  class="white-card">
			<div class="letters">
			<h2> O </h2>
			</div>
		<p>For Others,
		Another human being, considered as a person with whom a relationship of inter-subjectivity and moral relationships are woven</p>
